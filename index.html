    <!-- EXECUTIVE SUMMARY -->
    <section id="executive-summary">
      <span class="pill-label">Executive Summary</span>
      <h2>Semester Growth, Key Takeaways, and Future Goals</h2>
      <p>
        This semester in MGMT 316 pushed me to treat my life like a manager treats an organization:
        with clear goals, intentional plans, and constant course-correction. I began with three
        S.M.A.R.T. (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-based) goals around my career,
        social habits, and physical health. Professionally, I committed to pursuing an
        economics-related internship and using Chapman’s resources, LinkedIn, and networking to
        make that happen. Personally, I set the goal of cutting back on bars and fraternity parties
        to one planned night out per week. Physically, I aimed to gain five pounds of lean muscle
        through structured lifting and nutrition.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the semester unfolded, those goals forced me to grow. I learned that sending online
        applications was not enough; real progress came from conversations with professors,
        classmates, alumni, and recruiters, so I built a weekly system for targeted applications and
        deliberate “human touchpoints.” I also refined my social goal by scheduling nights out in
        advance, setting curfews, and tracking my next-day energy and focus so I could see the
        impact of my choices. A broken hand mid-semester forced me to rethink my fitness plan and
        pivot from muscle gain to maintaining strength and health with lower-body training, machines,
        cardio, and better nutrition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, I am carrying these lessons forward. I now know I can design simple systems
        that keep me consistent even when life gets messy. My next steps are to secure a strong
        internship, continue limiting social nights to protect my performance, and reset my
        post-injury strength goals once my cast is removed. This course showed me that effective
        management is really self-leadership: planning, organizing, leading, and controlling my own
        life so that I can show up as a better student, athlete, teammate, and future business
        professional.

    <!-- MISSION & VISION -->

      <span class="pill-label">Mission &amp; Vision</span>
      <h2>Who I Am Becoming as a Leader</h2>
      <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
      <p>
        I strive to live with integrity, curiosity, and resilience. I want to use my strengths in
        leadership and creativity to positively impact the people and environments around me and to
        continuously grow into a better human being.
      </p>

      <h3>Vision Statement</h3>
      <p>
        My vision is to build a life where I lead with intention, inspire others, and create
        experiences that foster growth, connection, and sustainable change for myself and the people
        I encounter.
      </p>

      <h3>Core Values in Action</h3>
      <p>
        These values shaped how I approached my goals this semester. Integrity guided my decision to
        limit partying and prioritize long-term health over short-term fun. Curiosity pushed me to
        explore internships, ask better questions, and seek feedback. Resilience showed up when my
        injury disrupted my training plan—I chose to adapt instead of quit. Together, these values
        define the kind of leader I want to become: someone who unites people, learns from setbacks,
        and keeps moving toward meaningful objectives.

    <!-- SMART GOALS -->
    <section id="smart-goals">
      <span class="pill-label">S.M.A.R.T. Goal Progress</span>
      <h2>Goals, Progress, and What I Learned</h2>

      <h3>Professional Goal – Economics Internship</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Original goal:</strong> Secure an internship in economics (with a focus on finance,
        policy, or business analysis) by applying to targeted roles during winter or summer
        interterm, using Chapman resources, networking, and online platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Progress and insight:</strong> I discovered that volume alone does not create
        opportunities—relationships do. Early on I mostly clicked “apply,” but the biggest momentum
        came when I reached out to professors and alumni. This led me to redesign my plan into a
        weekly system: two tailored applications and three meaningful touchpoints each week, plus a
        running bank of short stories I can use in interviews. I am still in the process of landing
        the internship, but I’m ending the semester with stronger networking habits and a clear
        structure to keep executing.
      </p>

      <h3>Personal Goal – Social Balance</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Original goal:</strong> Limit going to bars and fraternity parties to one planned
        night out per week, tracking outings on my phone to stay accountable and protect my health,
        finances, and focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Progress and insight:</strong> Most weeks I hit the target, especially when I chose
        my night in advance. The hardest times were high-event weekends, when “one night” could
        easily become a whole weekend. In response, I tightened the rule: pick my night by
        Wednesday, set an end time, and add one “non-party” hangout such as coffee, the gym, or
        dinner with a friend. I now track my next-day energy, focus, and productivity, which gives
        me evidence that smarter choices translate into better performance.
      </p>

      <h3>Physical Goal – Strength and Injury Management</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Original goal:</strong> Gain five pounds of lean muscle by December using
        progressive overload in the gym, weekly weigh-ins, and a high-protein diet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Progress and insight:</strong> A broken hand in early October forced me to pivot
        from muscle gain to injury-smart training. Instead of abandoning the goal, I reframed
        success as maintaining fitness: focusing on lower-body work, machines, cardio, and adequate
        protein while my hand healed. I did not hit the original weight target, but I prevented
        regression and protected my long-term health. This taught me that adapting goals to reality
        is a strength, not a failure, and that discipline includes knowing when to adjust
        expectations.
      </p>

    <!-- TEAM FEEDBACK -->
    <section id="team-feedback">
      <span class="pill-label">Team Feedback Summary</span>
      <h2>How Others See Me – and How I Responded</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout this course I received feedback from classmates and team members on how I show up
        in group settings. Their comments highlighted several consistent strengths: reliability,
        preparation, and a calm presence under pressure. Peers appreciated that I follow through on
        commitments, contribute thoughtfully rather than talking just to talk, and help keep the
        group organized and on track with deadlines. This connects strongly to my management focus
        on planning and organizing—skills I also used to structure internship applications and track
        my goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feedback also pointed out growth areas that I have started working on. Teammates encouraged
        me to speak up earlier in discussions, share my ideas with more confidence, and delegate
        instead of taking on too much myself. Combined with my own reflections on leadership during
        my injury and social-life changes, this pushed me to practice being more vocal, setting
        clearer expectations, and being honest about my limits. Going forward, I plan to actively
        ask for feedback during projects and to use it as a regular “control” step—just like in the
        four functions of management—to keep improving how I lead and collaborate.

      <h2>Semester Journals and Key Insights</h2>
      <p>
        My journals document the thinking behind this portfolio. They show how my goals, values, and
        strategies evolved throughout the semester.
      </p>

      <h3>Journal #1 – S.M.A.R.T. Goals</h3>
      <p>
        Established three S.M.A.R.T. goals: securing an economics-related internship, limiting
        social nights out, and gaining lean muscle through structured training and nutrition.
      </p>

      <h3>Journal #2 – Mission and Vision Statement</h3>
      <p>
        Clarified my mission, vision, and core values of integrity, curiosity, resilience,
        leadership, and creativity, and connected them to how I want to show up in school, work, and
        life.
      </p>

      <h3>Journal #3 – Review Goals</h3>
      <p>
        Conducted a mid-semester check-in, refining strategies for internship applications, social
        balance, and training systems, and identifying which habits were working and which needed to
        change.
      </p>

      <h3>Journal #5 – Goal Evaluation</h3>
      <p>
        Evaluated my progress using the four functions of management (planning, organizing, leading,
        controlling) and reflected on what I learned from successes, setbacks, and my injury. This
        journal set the foundation for the executive summary and my future goals.
